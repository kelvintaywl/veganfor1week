## Breakfast

- [Hojicha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C5%8Djicha)

I was rushing to work as I woke up late.

I had a hangover from yesterday's [hanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami).


## Lunch

- Crisp Saladworks' [Earthy Nutty Crunchy (ENC) salad](https://crisp.co.jp/eat)

I really like Crisp Saladworks! 

The salads are slightly pricey in my opinion but they are so good. ü•í

This was nothing too interesting, as I have always had salads for Monday lunches (my excuse to eat and drink without much care for the weekend earlier).

## Teatime

- Americano ‚òï

## Dinner

- Hummus


Always a favourite to make!

This has got to be one of the greatest 'accidentally vegan' option out there!

## Thoughts

I did some grocery shopping after evening yoga, but did not find myself craving meat, surprisingly. 

I guess I did not really walk past the meat sections, so that helped!

On the other hand, it is rather disheartening to know that so many foods I thought was vegan are not exactly vegan (for the ones found in SEIYU supermarket). Miso paste, natto, jelly.

I took 45 minutes to shop for stuff, since I had to Google translate all these ingredients. Learned a few new words that I would probably never use but hey, if you're not laughing, you're learning.
