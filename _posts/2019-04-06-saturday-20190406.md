## Breakfast

- Chocolate danish pastry

Egg on my face because I'm pretty sure there were traces of egg.

## Lunch

- Modified Thunder Tea Rice with mushrooms, corn, brocolli and cashew nuts

I found this to be really healthy and definitely tasty!

Would definitely be using these vegatable sides more often for this dish instead of my usual spinach, leeks and peanuts.

## Dinner

- [Soup Curry at Ponipirica](http://ponipirica.in/) 🍛
- [Beers at Mikkeller Tokyo](http://mikkeller.jp/) 🇩🇰

Dinner with a close friend visiting from Singapore.

Of course, I had to bring him on a soup curry pilgrimage to Shimokitazawa. And of course, to my favourite shop in the area!

I had the vegetable soup curry, but with the knowledge that the soup base would contain perhaps some fish (i think it would be Katsuo).


## Thoughts

Couldn't manage to get a reservation at the popular [Kurand Sake Market]() for all-you-can-drink sake.

A vegetarian ex-colleauge introduced me to that bar and rightly so, because it has a 'Bring Your Own Food' concept.
