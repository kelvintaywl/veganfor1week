## Breakfast

- Bran doughnut from Lawson 🍩


I think there was elements of egg white used in the doughnut so technically it was not vegan.

## Lunch

- Herb salted peanuts
- 2 packs of natto (kelp dressing or 昆布たれ)

This was a little sad for lunch.
However, I was busy and it was surprisingly filling.

## Teatime

- Chocolates from colleague (definitely not vegan) 🍫

## Dinner

- [Thunder Tea Rice](https://asianfoodnetwork.com/en/recipes/cuisine/chinese/Thunder-Tea-Rice.html)

This was always easy, quick and fun to make.

I normally would have used chicken boullion cubes and dried shrimps (小えび) for flavouring, but the wakame soup worked as a great substitute!

## Thoughts

At this point, I did not feel any different from any regular day of eating meat and all.
I suppose it is only the second day but I was kinda hoping I would feel some slight physiological changes or so.
