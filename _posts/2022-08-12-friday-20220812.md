## Breakfast

- Bran flakes
- Soyjoy plant-based breakfast bar

## Lunch

- Ginger cookie 🍪
- Truffle-flavoured Pringles
- Large cup of Americano ☕

> I had a busy day, so I had to somehow rush through lunch.
> It wasn't the usual complete meal, so I was looking forward to dinner.

## Dinner

- Vegan curry inari-sushi (bought by the wife!) 🍣
- Stir-fried bee-hoon in tan-tan sauce

> The inari-sushi from a pop-up store in Yoyogi-Uehara was really tasty.
> If anything, it felt nostalgic, flavour-wise, as it reminded me of curry puffs back home in Singapore.

## Thoughts

Surprisingly, tan-tan sauce went pretty well with bee-hoon.

The wife felt a little unwell, and we wondered if the diet was taking a "toll".

We decided we dont have to go vegan completely till Sunday.

The most important thing is to listen to our bodies after all.
