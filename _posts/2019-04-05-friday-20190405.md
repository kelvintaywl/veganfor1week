title: "Falafel Fridays ü•ô"

## Breakfast

Hmm, no recollections here.

## Lunch

- Falafel Rice from the [Falafel Brothers]()

Falafels are not spherical but disk-shaped! 

It was amazing to be able to get Baba Ganoush as a side too. 
Price-wise, perhaps a slight pricey considering I had a set meal which included fries and an orange tea (1,400yen) but I would be back, even after this 1 week journey!

## Teatime

- Salt and Pepper Peanuts

## Dinner

- Soba with walnut sauce dip

Made this again!

I intend to use the Hokkaido soba I got as part of [Furusato Nozei](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/furusato-nozei/) the next time.

## Late Night Izakaya

- Beers, Highballs
- Fries with Mentaiko sauce (oh no)
- Chicken Skin skewers (my first land meat for this week)

## Thoughts

Happy Friday,people! 

Of course, I broke the rules this night, but considering it was just part of side (e.g., mentaiko mayonnaise), I think I did okay.

Chicken skin was of course another matter, but hey, it's Friday and it was just 1 skewer of chicken skin üçó

Surprised I didnt give in to any main meat options at the Izakaya!
