## Breakfast

Looks like I missed recording my breakfast.

## Lunch

Same here.

I must have either cheated, or passed out.

## Dinner

- Tuna Avocado with Gochujang sauce 🥑
- Swordfish steak and mushroom rissotto (I know)
- Banana cake

## Thoughts

Yes, I sadly had to break the rules this evening as I was having a celebratory dinner with a friend and I didn't choose the restaurant. It was at [Crista](https://www.tysons.jp/crista/) in Shibuya.

The food was really good though, and would totally recommend for a dinner date, if you want to splash those cash!

Just make sure your date is not vegan, of course!
