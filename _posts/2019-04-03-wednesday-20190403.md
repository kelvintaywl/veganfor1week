## Breakfast

- Konbu [onigiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri)
- Americano

I think this is the best bet for vegan onigiris.

## Lunch

- Vegetable Torta (:avocado: :tomato:) with fries from [Cafe Habana](http://cafehabana.jp/)

It is indeed challenging to find dining options for the strict vegans in Tokyo.

## Dinner

- Soba with walnut sauce dip (くるみだれ蕎麦) 🍜

How can you not like walnut, cashew nut, miso and soy sauce as the dipping sauce?

This was so simple to make!

## Thoughts

Through crowdsourcing for opinions at work, I found that are indeed some nice or fancy vegan options around downtown Tokyo.

[Happycow](https://www.happycow.net/asia/japan/tokyo/) is definitely a good site to take a look at, for vegans new to Tokyo 🗼

Feeling slightly edgy, as perhaps my body start to realize the 'lack' of meat?

However, I do suspect I just need to smartly replace my meals with ingredients that provide the usual amount of iron, protein, etc that I got out of my regular diet (which sadly consisted of fried chicken から揚げ and highballs for dinner).

I miss my fried chicken.
