## Thoughts

Concluded this vegan week.

To be fair, it was more like 6 days.
However, it was interesting to see how my body felt energetic at the start.
Eventually, the wife and I felt more tired during the week.
I think the diet and the weather played a part, however we did enjoy sourcing for vegan options around town!
