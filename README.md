# vegan for 1 week

Sessions recorded:

- April 1st - April 7th 2019
- August 8th - August 14th 2022

## Introduction

I wanted to try out veganism (in terms of food intake), just for a week, at least.

I intend to keep all attempted vegan recipes throughout this week.

The goal was mainly to explore how easy it is to cook or find vegan cuisines around Tokyo, Japan (where I am based at this period).

This should be fun!
